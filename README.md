# project
 My project is a simple tele-marketing website with room for customised integration of users preferences.
 
 Customers are able to sign up and immediately start managing their customers, they can import a CSV or excel containing a list of clients, which will be imported into a dynamically created database where clients will be stored. 
 Customers are able to create users with the role of a supervisor or agent whom will have their respective access througout the website.
 Agents are able to make calls when going into the softphone page where they'll see their assigned clients which are automatically updated by the system once they're all done
